		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a landscape painting of the San Francisco bay, atop the hill where the Legion of Honor museum is located. I did back in community college while taking a color theory course. I used acrylic paints with gesso to get an atmospheric look as well as the look of the water. This course helped me get over the fear of painting, and the techniques and knowledge of color theory to help me in other mediums.</p>
