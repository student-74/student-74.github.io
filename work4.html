		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of my first games while pursuing my career as a future maker of games, be it a designer or one that contributes code and art. Space2 is the title of the game as it is a basic space shooter with a twist, no spoiler here. It was fun and engaging to learn a new program, Gamemaker Studio, even if it's not the best game designing tool. I was in a team of too, with me being the designer, artist, and assist programmer, only when required. Many players who've played the game are fascinated by the art along with the nostalgic feel it gives to experienced gamers. Link to a executable is provided below. </p>
