		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before attending San Jose State University, I mainly focused on art history along with pictorial arts. I did this to get a good and solid understanding of the arts before I branch into the digital world. Once I began learning here at SJSU I was given the opportunity to work with several digital programs. Blender was one of the newly learned programs, and it was similar to Maya in the fact it was a 3D modeling program. It took awhile to relearn the basics of 3D modeling while using a new program, but the results of several tutorials brought to me this little scenic house. The house has a few textures on it to give the sense of a roof as well as see-through windows. </p>
