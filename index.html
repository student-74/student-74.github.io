		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since I was a young lad, I was intrigued by video games. Not only were they entertainment for me at an early age, but they did something that not a lot of other forms of entertainment had for me at least, and that was immersion. Video games were like portals to other worlds; and unlike books, movies, and other forms of entertainment, theses video games were completely interactive with the narrative as well. Growing up during the rise of video games seeded the inspiration within me to pursue a career in the video game industry. 
	To do that I had to figure out what skills I possessed that would help achieve my degree. My skills with a pencil and with creative ideas helped me push and succeed in becoming an artist. My current skills are more oriented towards digital media, from digital painting, to coding, to 3D modeling and web design, but I also achieved and have a rich background in pictorial arts and global art history. Using the knowledge, skill, and practice that comes from schools and self-practice has put me in a balanced position where I can only go forward with advancing my artistic skill.
	 I reach towards that same goal of that the video games of my past did well, and that is to create an immersive and interactive experience that is not tied down to the realm of reality. I enjoy to focus on the fantasy. I have created games, digital and physical, that span over different genres and partake in a engaging setting that puts you into the story as you drive the narrative. The genres of my games have no limits, as I have created games from a text-based horror to a Sci-fi shooters.
	My head is not solely locked onto the digital world, which has been my focus since attending University, but also focused on the beauty and life of our planet, Earth, from the landscapes the world provides to the organisms she creates. 
	I strive to figure out how to provide engaging art that will take the viewer to a place not known but still familiar, to transform the viewer in to a Zen-like state where nothing is in between you and the art.
